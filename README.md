# React Nanodegree Projects

## Getting started with projects

Always start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

- outline the steps needed to build the project
- draw the application
- what individual screens would look like
- how the Components are connected to each other
- write down the architecture
- develop the app piece by piece

And just before submitting:

- squash all bugs
- check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements
- Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! 🙌🏼
